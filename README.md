   ```bash
   ant war
   ```
   Copy the generated `HRC.war` file to Tomcat's `webapps` directory

private static final String USERNAME = "sa";
private static final String PASSWORD = "yourPassword";
```

### Build Configuration
The project uses Apache Ant for building. Key targets:
- `ant compile`: Compile Java source files
- `ant war`: Create deployable WAR file
- `ant clean`: Clean build artifacts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Verify MSSQL is running
   - Check connection credentials in `DBConnect.java`
   - Ensure database `hrc` exists

   - Ensure Java 17 is installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set
   - Verify Apache Ant is installed and in PATH
   - Check all required dependencies are present

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Ensure Tomcat 10 is used (Jakarta EE compatibility)
   - Check Tomcat logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify WAR file is properly deployed
